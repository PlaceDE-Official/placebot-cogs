syntax_explanation: "Read given information as follows: <CHANNEL><MODE><MAX_LENGTH><LOG>"
mode_explanation: |
  **Modes:**
  - `1`: Message can only contain images (or links to images).
  - `2`: Message can only contain emotes. 
  - `4`: Messages can only contain text, no images or emotes (links are allowed though).  
  This modes can be mixed (sum the numbers), to allow multiple things together, e.g.
  mode `5` allows images and text, but no emotes.
  
  `max_length`:
  - Every image and emote is treated as one "character". 
  - Has no effect if set to 0.
  
  `log`:
  - If true, an alert will be sent and a ulog entry created if a user sends a non-compliant message.
  - If false, no warning will be shown to the user; the message is deleted silently.
  - This setting exists to reduce spam for channels with high message volume, like StageChannels during events.
