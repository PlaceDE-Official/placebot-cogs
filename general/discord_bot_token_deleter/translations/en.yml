title: Discord Bot Token Deleter
description: >
  You sended a message with a Discord Bot Token into this Channel.
  I deleted this message because other people can use this Token to control this Bot!
  You can regenerate the Discord Bot Token in the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications):
    - Select the Application
    - Click on "Bot" in the Side Menu
    - Click on "Regenerate" to regenerate the Token

  [This message]({}) contains a Discord bot token but I could not delete it because I don't have `manage_messages` permission in {}.
